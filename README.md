# Handwritten Maths Notes from UCL

A chosen selection of the handwritten notes that I scanned when I was a maths undergraduate at University College London (UCL).

## Comment on Skills and Post-16 Education Bill https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2868

In the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill, Part 4, Chapter 1 on “CHEATING SERVICES PROVIDED FOR POST-16 STUDENTS AT ENGLISH INSTITUTIONS” and Section 29, Meaning of “relevant service” and other key expressions.

I do NOT provide a “relevant service” as materials are published generally.

All materials are available generally without payment 

In addition, some materials are contained in publications that contains other educational or training material and is available generally.

## Further Materials

I do have more scanned notes and further materials like revision guides, papers and solutions. They are available on request, please contact me via email at kin.quan.10@ucl.ac.uk. If you are a UCL student then please use your UCL email address. 

All resources are free.
