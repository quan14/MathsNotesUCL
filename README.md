# Handwritten Maths Notes from UCL

A chosen selection of the handwritten notes that I scanned when I was a maths undergraduate at University College London (UCL).

## Further Materials

I do have more scanned notes and further materials like revision guides, papers and solutions. They are available at request, please contact me via email at kin.quan.10 (AT) ucl.ac.uk, if you are a UCL student then please use your UCL email address.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to all the people that have allowed me to scan the notes and the having the patience endure all my pleas.
